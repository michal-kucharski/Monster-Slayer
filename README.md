# Monster-Slayer
This is my version of first project in Maximillian Schwarzmuller Vue.js course on Udemy. 

I added some depth to the game with few new mechanics. I was writing whole JS code on my own, but template HTML and CSS are from course resources. 

Changes: 

- added 'Defense Up' mechanic
- added cooldowns on 'Special Attack, Heal, and Defense Up' 
- added keyboard controls
- added cheatsheet 

I am not using GIT on this project, cause at the beginning I wasn't sure how far the changes will go, but now I think project is eligible to show. That's why I am using GitHub online to add my code, you can see more of my GIT skills in other projects.
